# MixedMessages
Co-Op Mixed Messages Project.

This is a project from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineering Career Path.
These are the instructions copied from https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-22-portfolio-project-javascript-syntax/modules/fscp-22-group-project-mixed-messages/kanban_projects/mixed-messages:
    
    For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

    Project Objectives:
    Build a message generator program using JavaScript
    Use Git version control
    Use command line
    Develop locally on your computer
    Prerequisites:
    JavaScript
    Git and GitHub
    Command line
   
   
We decided to have our message generator generate the word "hello" in a random language, accompanied by the country flag of the languages origin.
The JavaScript in the ./main.js file provides the functionality of the message generator. The page is styled both using Bootstrap and CSS in the ./styles.css file
